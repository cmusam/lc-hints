brute force: generate all '%02d:%02d' % (hh, mm)

smarter way:

 2 3 : 5 9
 a b : c d

Make a sorted list of unique digits
(2, 3, 5, 9)

d is not max?
 Y: set to nextBig, DONE
 N: set to min

(c is not max AND nextBig <= 5)?
 Y: set to nextBig, DONE
 N: set to min

(b is not max AND (10*a + nextBig <= 23)?
 Y: set to nextBig, DONE
 N: set to min

(a is not max AND (10*nextBig + b <= 23))?
 Y: set to nextBig, DONE
 N: set to min
